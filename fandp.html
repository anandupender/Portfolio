      </div>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>First Thoughts</h2>
        <p>During the IDEO coLAB's hackweek we focused on the polarization of media on widely debated subjects such as the gentrification of the Mission and the Israeli Palestine Conflict.  Facts & Perspectives curates a crowdsourced timeline of these events and situations. With sections for context, curated via local activists and credible news agencies, and perspectives, written by on-the-ground local voices, F&P provides an overarching, live updating picture of situations ranging from the Turkish coup to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to gentrification in San Francisco’s Mission District.</p>
        <p>The really cool part? F&P limits contributors to locals by geofencing the content that’s submitted and then upvoted. It’s a platform intended to amplify local voices, and provide an ear to the ground in places where it’s difficult to separate external opinions from the experiences of those living it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h1>Hypothesis: People care about seeing the answers to issue-specific questions written by local.</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>First Mockup</h2>
        <p>With my first prototype, I split the content into three main buckets: perspectives, questions, and a timeline. The mock does not focus on aesthetics but instead intended to experiment with information hierarchy on the page.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perspectives: The thoughts of people actually affected by the news we are learning about</li>
          <li>Timeline: An objective history of events from many reputable media sources geographically near the affected area</li>
          <li>Questions: Quick FAQs to get caught up on an issue</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>Second Mockup</h2>
        <h1>Hypothesis: Users are more interested in seeing general "blog-style" perspectives of locals.</h1>
        <p>Basic user testing led to a larger focus on the perspectives of different "profiles" or contributors to an issue. We found a young girl named Jana Jihad who was reporting on the Israel Palestine conflict from her mobile phone and sharing on social media. People have the tools to share their stories but the barriers to becoming those contributors can seem high. There is also no consolidated place for the consumers of this content to view these stories and understand the validity and truth of their information.</p>
        <p>The timeline became more amorphous and the facts or objective information was added to the left as a supplementary section.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>Final Built Prototype</h2>
        <h1>Hypothesis: An initial focus on the timeline allows new users to get objectively caught up quickly and then minimize this screen portion to allow exploration of the locals' perspectives</h1>
        <p>At the end of the week we built the site using public JS libraries for the timeline functionality. We filled in the site with real content rom three actual independent journalists as if they were contributing to the platform. </p>
        <p>The main design decisions</p>
        <ul
          <li>Highlight the ongoing issue (Israel & Palestine)</li>
          <li>Create quick FAQs to get caught up on the objective facts (Context)</li>
          <li>Focus the display of information of the perspectives of the writers experiencing the conflicts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Final Product</h2>
        <p>It's not perfect but its a glimpse at a way to share crowdsourced news geographically tied to where we are getting our news.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <ul
          <li>There is value in giving quick recaps of the events that have contributed to the history of an issue or topic</li>
          <li>Today's reader may be more interested in intimate stories from local witnesses (boutique) rather than the curated stories of uninvolved news organizations</li>
          <li>People are already crowdsourcing journalism using social media platforms like Vine and Youtube</li>
          <li>Validation and unbiased information is a hard problem - perhaps images/videos are the solution</li>
        </ul>
