# Portfolio
My older Personal Portfolio created in Dec. 2018 and refined constantly.

#### Intentionality
Over the years my portfolios have evolved from a Google Site to a Tumblr blog to a Weebly site and finally a Squarespace site. However I kept coming back to the idea that my portfolio should do more than show my work - it should capture my essence. This current site is a combination of years of browsing others' amazing portfolios, gaining confidence in web design skills, and messing around with fun JS libraries like rellax.js.
