# Portfolio
My Personal Evolving Portfolio updated in Marc. 2021 and refined constantly

#### Intentionality
Over the years my portfolios have evolved from a Google Site to a Tumblr blog to a Weebly site and finally a Squarespace site. However I kept coming back to the idea that my portfolio should do more than show my work - it should capture my essence. This current site is a combination of years of browsing others' amazing portfolios, gaining confidence in web design skills, and messing around with fun JS libraries like rellax.js. 

#### About this site
This site is the culmination of two years of backburner pondering. Tools used to create this site include paper, pencil and Figma for design, Gulp for dev workflow automation, Sass for css preprocessing, Tilt.js for fun motion, aos.js for cutting edge animations, and swup.js for page animations. Typography is set in Fraunces and Roboto. Much of the interactions are handmade from the cursor-tracking face to the physics engine behind the magnets.


THERE'S MORE TO COME...
