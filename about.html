          Hi there! My name is <b>Anand</b>. I'm a designer, tinkerer, and aspiring chef based in Stanford, CA. I believe in vibrant communities and am a sucker for <b>old fashioned malt milkshakes</b>. </br></br>
          I'm a senior at Stanford and excited for what the future holds. I spent two amazing summers working with the design nerds at <b>IDEO CoLab</b>, then worked on a storytelling feature for the elderly at <b>Facebook</b>. In between I worked at a YC-backed sous vide hardware company called <b>Cinder</b>.</br></br>
          At Stanford, I lead a team of students to conduct unconventional automobile research with the <b>Ford Innovation Center</b>, I manage the <b>Stanford Robotics Club</b> as their president, and I play trumpet in a quirky, <b>democratic chamber orchestra</b>.</br></br>
          In my free time I make minimalist wallets and mess around with <b>Arduinos</b>. In 2015, I created and curated a <b>TEDx</b> in my hometown that is still running today. Experimental cooking is pretty cool.</br></br>
