                <p>
                    I'm a designer, coder, and aspiring chef interested in supporting global communities and making people's lives more delightful. I currently work at <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/">TED conferences</a> trying to tackle the problems of misinformation, hate speech, and online polarization. I'm equally at home brainstorming and designing elegant user journeys as I am about writing the code that delivers these experiences to real people. I tend to create high fidelity, live prototypes to help find solutions to thorny interaction problems that often exist beyond static mockups. In general, I love making abstract ideas ans systems, tangible.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Prior to TED, I've been a part of the <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.ideocolab.com/">IDEO CoLab</a> community as a Fellow during their second and third cohorts. There, diverse creatives team up to dream the future of emerging technologies. Prototyping is a required skill. I also interned at <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> as their first "Design engineering" intern. On the AI Design team, I blurred the line between engineering and design with my quirky, talented design team. At <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>, I was able to work with and even lead teams inside large organizations such as the Ford Innovation Center, Hyatt Regency, Pear VC, and Cinder.

                    When I'm not learning a new JS tool or interviewing users, I'm <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/pixels_and_plates/">cooking</a>, playing trumpet, or listening to music. <a class="highlight" onclick="openMore()">Read more...</a>

                    I started my journey in design as an engineering student at Stanford. I did the startup thing: TAed for the Lean Startup class in the business school, built a project in the Pear VC garage program, worked at a YC-backed startup called Cinder, and finally interning at one of the large tech companies. Disillusioned with design thinking and looking to learn more about Design, I moved to Denmark to work at a traditional design agency. The danes taught me a lot about joy, cosiness, and the power of ritualistic celebration. Then, allured by NYC and the inspirational non-profit world of TED, I decided to move to Brooklyn to lead design on a new misinformation project being incubated there.

                    Going back further, my grandparents immigrated to the US from India in the 60s with less than $20 to their name. Both my grandmas often worked 3 jobs at a time and are a constant reminder of my privilege and how hard humans can work to make their family. Anand, means joy in Gujarati, and is also <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anand,+Gujarat,+India/@22.5488686,72.9097145,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x395e4e7efd0c8885:0xa9a0b93c0c4b5215!8m2!3d22.5645175!4d72.928871">the town</a> my mother grew up in. We are an interdependent family unit who expresses love through cooking and incessant worrying about each other.

                <p>
                    This site is the culmination of two years of backburner pondering. Tools used to create this site include paper, pencil and <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> for design, <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> for dev workflow automation, <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> for css preprocessing, <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/">Tilt.js</a> for fun motion, <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/">aos.js</a> for cutting edge animations, and <a class="highlight" target="_blank" href="https://swup.js.org/">swup.js</a> for page animations. Typography is set in Fraunces and Roboto. Much of the interactions are handmade from the cursor-tracking face to the physics engine behind the magnets.
