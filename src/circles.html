            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                TED Circles is a new and growing global community of learners who get together in small pods to gain new perspectives. In essence, they are book clubs around TED talks. Similar to TEDx, TED Circles has a simple "licensing" model where TED provides its brand to facilitate the creativity of local "Hosts." Given this flexible structure, Hosts sometimes operate outside of TED's awareness, creating events opaque to us. The Circles team came to me with a need to incentivize Hosts to schedule their events through TED, thereby allowing us to have a better sense of the success of the group, connect Circles in the same region, and provide customer support.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section" data-aos="fade-up">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>
                The preexisting solution was a Google Form that Hosts filled out for each event. It functioned well but didn't provide any clear value to the Hosts, so it was often unused. Early on, I solidified a design principle of creating win-win scenarios in which Hosts <i>and</i> TED benefit from events created in our ecosystem. Tactically, this meant: <span class="bold">Whenever you ask someone to take the time to input information, provide something in return.</span>

        <div class="project-section" data-aos="fade-up">
            <h2>Take One...</h2>
            <p>
                In order to implement some of the above principles, I worked with the Circles team to brainstorm ways to support the Hosts. We decided on a system for creating invitations – something visually appealing that they could send to their friends that would also make them look good.

            <h2>Redstructuring the Tech Stack in Airtable</h2>
            <p>
                Since TED Circles was a new, small team, their internal processes were lean and hands-on. Given their desire to quickly iterate the tool and community, I decided to create a new stack outside of the normal, heavy TED.com infra. Instead of involving 2-3 engineers to create custom APIs and a database admin panel, I adapted a tool they were already using – Airtable – to fit our stack. Although unconventional, we use Airtable as the sole database for Circles events. This allows the team to create email automations and other fancy interactions without touching a messy backend. So, the tool uses the Airtable JS API along with Netlify Functions to hide the API keys. Netlify also hosts our static site.

            <h2>Key features of the tool</h2>

                Here are a few features that were built over 1-2 months of in-the-wild testing.

                    <p>
                        Using tilt.js, I tried to give the invitations a sense of physicallity.

                    <p>
                        Many browsers do not have native date and time pickers. So, I had to use external libraries to catch and test the many edge cases of these inputs.

            <p>
                The TED Circles community is an iterative experiment that will grow over time - so, that has been my development approach. The Event Generator site was announced at the 1-year-anniversary celebration of the community. People expressed deep gratitude in having such thought and care given to something that they used often. <span class="bold">Over 2,000 event invitations were created in the few months after launch.</span> Early success led to a large round of QA testing and bug fixes and the tool has been serving the community well!
