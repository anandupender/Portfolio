        <h2>First Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          At the beginning of ME203, Stanford's intense manufacturing class, we
          were tasked with simultaneously learning to use the lathe, mill, and
          metal sand casting tools and creating final project ideas, BOMs, and
          sketches. I naturally went back to my list of product ideas from high
          school. A musical rock that reacted to your movements. A chair that
          hung from a large metal ring. Nothing caught on with my team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then began revolving around my passion for food and cooking and
          found a sweet spot: milkshakes. There is an intangible quality of
          milkshakes that makes them universally adored and reminds us of the
          “good ol’ days.” Milkshakes were the one thing as a not sweet tooth
          that I loved as a kid and never made because my mom was kind enough to
          have them ready for my brother and I. So I set out on inventing this
          device.
        </p>

        <h2>Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          Below is a mix of my engineering drawings and initial ergonomic
          sketches of the machine. These also include diagrams for the strain
          relief that was later necessary for the wiring.

        <h2>The Electronics</h2>
        <p>
          The first main step was to identify the electronics to use. The main
          components necessary were a motor, speed controls, mixing attachment,
          fan, and on/off switch. I researched many variable-speed DC motors and
          after consulting the teaching assistants, decided that since the class
          was not focused on electronics, I shouldn't focus time on making
          custom hardware. Instead, I found a Hamilton Beach Milkshake maker on
          Amazon that I promptly bought, brought to a gathering with friends to
          use once before its death, and then took it apart for its parts. These
          dimensions were the main constraints that went into the design of
          MALT.

        <h2>Foam Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          I started building with the least-cost and easiest to shape material:
          modulan foam. After some sanding, I ended up with a looks-like,
          works-like prototype.

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>Metal Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          After a quick design critique, I moved onto the first MVP for making
          MALT happen: creating a grasp-able shape that the motor could house in
          and be powered.
