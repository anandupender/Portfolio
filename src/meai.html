        <h2>First Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike a "typical" IDEO process, we began with interviews with experts
          in the field of consumer recommendations, advertisement, and data
          collection rather than the end users. We aimed to uncover patterns and
          opportunities in AI that fit frictionlessly into our daily lives. Here
          are some learnings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Much of Facebook's seemingly granular information (on its ad
            platform) about its users is either old, irrelevant content.
            Non-social content such as music taste, shopping habits, or dream
            vacations are isolated to other platforms. Need to learn more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spotify uses Collaborative Filtering to recommend new songs based on
            the music preferences of listeners with a similar taste (i.e.
            similar playlists).
          </li>
          <li>
            Stitchfix has an interesting onboarding survey (~7 mins) to help
            understand the fashion style of a new user. This solves the cold
            start problem for them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Netflix is built under the assumption that if users have to search
            for content for over 1-2 minutes they will leave. Therefore tedious
            process of type search is hidden and focus is on good
            recommendations!

        <h2>Changing From Demographics to Personas (AI Insight #1)</h2>
        <p>
          Very early on we found a correlation between people with similar
          interests, hobbies, or intangible "design appreciation" and their
          product preferences. Rather than recommending products from people in
          similar demographics, we believe a deeper understanding of unusual
          descriptors of a user can lead to better or at least more diverse
          recomendations.

      <div class="project-section">
        <p>
          Here you can see how we believe a shift from demographic buckets to
          more abstracted categories may be the key to actually "understanding"
          people's preferences online. What if my Bowers and Wilkins headphone
          purchase was more related to the fact that I'm an industrial designer
          and hip hop lover than the fact that I'm a techie aged 20.

        <h2>Utilizing Amazon Mechanical Turk (Experiment #1)</h2>
        <p>
          The framework from above led us to test if people's perception of the
          personas they were a part of actually influenced product preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Original Hypothesis: do the "personas" or groups that people label
          themselves as correspond to the products they buy? More interestingly,
          do two outdoorsy people share a love of not only similar hiking boots
          (obvious) but also perhaps similar headphones?
        </p>
        <p>
          Using Mechanical Turk, we collected >10,000 data points on products
          with inconclusive but interesting results from collaborative filtering
          algorithms. To the left are the results from running the model with
          grouped individuals versus every "user." There seemed to be a trend in
          which narrowing categories of users down to "Deal Finders" and
          "Fashionistas" yielded much higher predictions of preference for a
          specific product.

        <p>
          It's weird that advertisements are areas that consumers feel unsafe
          clicking because of their direct links away from what we're doing!
          They are often irrelevant and creep us out when they know too much
          that we didn't explicitly tell them.

        <p>
          Hypothesis: people will feel compelled to create a more robust AI
          model if their data is transparently given to a company rather than
          being taken from them without consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built a Chrome Extension that allows you to block ads but instead
          fill them with a "sandbox" to look through products that your personal
          store recommends. Any choices here are reflected when you next visit
          your curated site.

          There is a very interesting mindset shift from sites being static
          deliverers of content to users and instead, dynamic beings we can
          change and interact with. To test one aspect of this, we allow one of
          the large image cells to be filled with whatever the user is feeling
          in the moment. Not only does this give the user a sense of ownership
          over the space, it helps us collect data on what they feel when
          shopping.
