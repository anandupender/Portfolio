            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
            “I wish I knew about my grandma’s first date!” We heard this and many
            other similar wishes from 18-25 year olds who were regretful of the
            fact that they did not or do not currently know the stories of their
            families. Younger and older generations are increasingly isolated from
            their families, as younger people move out of their houses earlier for
            work and education. At the same time, loneliness is affecting more
            American than ever in both the older and younger demographics alike,
            leading to mental disorders and early onset memory problems!
            </p>
            <p>
            People have already anecdotally shown a huge aspirational interest in
            wanting to collect family memories (and genealogy). We hypothesize
            that audio is the perfect medium to easily capture and save these
            stories. Our main insight led us to create a truly accessible system
            where anything from a landline phone to a new iPhone X could access
            the same experience, reducing friction as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
            We recently won a grant from the Stanford Longevity Center and are
            testing this concept with around 10 families and friends.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
            My grandmother, Baji, wanted to capture her immigrant stories filled
            with struggle and miracles, and share them with my siblings and I. She
            found it difficult to write them on paper without any questions to
            prompt her (blank page problem). It was a slow process so we set her
            up with Microsoft Word so at least her spelling would be helped.
            Though, since she didn’t grow up with the keyboard interface, she
            found it tiring. Finally, we decided to have weekly phone calls that I
            would record and spend hours editing into podcasts for the rest of my
            family to hear.

                Modern families in the U.S. are often split over a large geographic
                region, leaving less time for interaction with each other.
            </li>
            <li>
                Older family members find it difficult to use modern technology
                tools and therefore require the assistance and time-commitment of
                younger family members in sharing their thoughts. (ex. Setting up a
                FB or having a child record their stories manually)
            </li>
            <li>
                It can be difficult to know the right questions to ask family to
                tell their stories.

            <h2>Thesis</h2>
            <h3>
            We are using simple audio interfaces that work across any device in
            order to make a super simple platform to encourage conversation among
            generations. These conversations are then saved as audio “podcasts”
            that can be viewed and edited by anyone in a family.

            <h2>Iteration - React Native</h2>
            <p>
            Initially, our instinct was to build out the full user experience with
            a focus on user interface. The system was built using React Native and
            a firebase database. We quickly learned how difficult it would be to
            test this prototype app with older users given their reduced
            technological literacy and the long wait times with app stores.

            <h2>Iteration - Twilio Phone-based System</h2>
            <p>
            The second time around, we focused on maximizing the potential to
            learn from users. The system was built with accesibility in mind from
            the ground up. Instead of an app, older users can call into a literl
            phone number. This involved creating a voice UX using Twilios
            automated phone systems.

            <p>
            This project is ongoing and will continue to evolve as we bring it to
            a larger audience. Thusfar, we have validated the business opportunity
            by winning the 2019 Stanford Longevity Center Design Challenge. From a
            desirability standpoint, we are continuing to test our Twilio
            interface with a small set of family and friends. The main goal now is
            to turn the Minimum Viable Product into a Minimum "Loveable" Product.
            By creating something that is fully functional, we lost our simple
            visual experience.

            also users.
