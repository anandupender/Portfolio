Facts & Perspectives curates a crowdsourced timeline of these events and situations. With sections for context, curated via local activists and credible news agencies, and perspectives, written by on-the-ground local voices, F&P provides an overarching, live updating picture of situations ranging from the Turkish coup to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to gentrification in San Francisco’s Mission District.</p><p>The really cool part? F&P limits contributors to locals by geofencing the content that’s submitted and then upvoted. It’s a platform intended to amplify local voices, and provide an ear to the ground in places where it’s difficult to separate external opinions from the experiences of those living it.</p></div><div class="project-section"><h2>Hypothesis</h2><h1>People can better empathize with global issues when news is reported by unbiased locals who share first-person experiences.</h1></div><div class="project-section"><h2>First Mockup</h2><p>With my first prototype, I split the content into three main buckets: perspectives, questions, and a timeline. The mock does not focus on aesthetics but instead intended to experiment with information hierarchy on the page.</p><ul><li>Perspectives: The thoughts of people actually affected by the news we are learning about</li><li>Timeline: An objective history of events from many reputable media sources geographically near the affected area</li><li>Questions: Quick FAQs to get caught up on an issue</li></ul></div><div class="project-image-container" style="height: 30%;"><img src="images/fandp/mockup.jpeg" class="project-image add-shadow"></div><div class="spacer-medium"></div><div class="project-section"><h2>User Research</h2><p>While resesarching how local perspectives got shared, we came across 10 year old Jana Jihad. She is a youth activist who began reporting on the Israel-Palestine conflict when she was 7. People outside of her won country were able to rally behind her cause and empathize with the violence through iPhone videos posted on sites like Facebook and Youtube.</p></div><div class="project-image-container" style="height: 30%;"><img src="images/fandp/jana.jpeg" class="project-image add-shadow"></div><h3 class="image-caption">Jana Jihad, popular 10 year Palestinian old activist who gained an audience through social media</h3><div class="project-section"><h2>Second Hypothesis</h2><h1>People are interested in seeing the personality of locals through a more "blog-style" information architecture.</h1><p>Basic user testing led to a larger focus on the perspectives of different "profiles" or contributors to an issue. We found a young girl named Jana Jihad who was reporting on the Israel Palestine conflict from her mobile phone and sharing on social media. People have the tools to share their stories but the barriers to becoming those contributors can seem high. There is also no consolidated place for the consumers of this content to view these stories and understand the validity and truth of their information.</p><p>The timeline became more amorphous and the facts or objective information was added to the left as a supplementary section.</p></div><div class="project-image-container" style="height: 30%;"><img src="images/fandp/mockup2.jpeg" class="project-image add-shadow"></div><div class="project-section"><h2>Final Built Prototype</h2><p>At the end of the week we built the site using public JS libraries for the timeline functionality.
