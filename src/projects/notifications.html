        <h1>Parody Notifications</h1>
        <p>Every single day, we are bombarded by notifications from our many digital devices. At one point in time, these "pings" and "dings" were exciting...the apps had real things to share! Remember when someone would post a group photo to your Facebook wall? Or when you'd recieve emails from real people you actually know?</p>

        <p>
            Parody Notifications aims to show how hard these tech companies are trying to get our attention surfacing the most irrelevant content posisble.
