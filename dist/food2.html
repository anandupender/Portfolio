I was raised in a town outside Washington DC and grew up going to the nation's greatest (most free) museums. I believe in vibrant communities and am a sucker for old fashioned malt milkshakes. I spent two amazing summers working with the design nerds at IDEO CoLab, then worked on a storytelling platform for the elderly at Facebook. In between I worked at a YC-backed sous vide hardware company called Cinder. I just finished a stint with a small branding agency in Copenhagen called Urgent.Agency. I'm currently building products at TED in the misinformation space. In my free time I make minimalist wallets and mess around with Arduinos. In 2015, I created and curated a TEDx in my hometown that is still running today. Experimental cooking is pretty cool. I'm humbled to have worked with amazing thinkers, professors, students, and mentors including but not limited to Barbara Karanian, Ge Wang, Eric Norman, William Ngan, Nadine Levin, Gavin McDermott, Joel Kwartler, Annie Brantigan, Daniel Chan, Ashwin Agarwal, Justin McKissik, and many other amazing thinkers.</div></div><script src="js/addFace.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/headerfooter.min.js"></script></body><style>body{
