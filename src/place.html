            This is an ongoing collection of my thoughts on designing for the
            spaces around us. Although not a part of my core design practice, it
            is a lens that a constantly see through in crafting experiences. Below
            are a few principles and the projects that brought them to life.

            <h2>Multisensory Experiences</h2>
            <p>
            Certain senses are overplayed or neglected in different cultures. The
            impacts on memory and delight of visual versus auditory stimuli are
            very different and therefore require more intentional design. In

            This project above was called Biryaniria, a pop-up dinner named after
            the popular South Indian rice dish, Biryani. It wa not only an
            exercise in culinary ability and organization but in space and
            experience design. Speaking about the Multisensory: every table had a
            beautiful pice of wood picked from nature, incense that filled the
            room with a homey smell, crayons and butcher paper allowed guests to
            express themselves creatively, and they were encouraged to eat with
            their hands on topp of that.

            <h2>Design for Moments</h2>
            <p>
            It can be hard to define what makes an "experience" or even worse,
            what makes an experience "good." In my own design practice I think
            that a successful experience centers around understanding where people
            are at (emotionally, mentally, physically...) at different moments in
            which they interact with your offering. Specifically, I see designing
            for moments as being intentional about how you create touch points for
            your users by fully understanding their "journey maps" even long
            before and after the experience.

            This project above was in understanding the full customer experience
            for a sous vide hardware startup called Cinder. After we had
            established a solid, working product, we wanted to create an
            experience that early adopters would want to tell their friends about.
            This involved thinking about the onboxing moment, the waiting time
            period, and the returning procedure.

            <h2>Designing Rituals</h2>
            <p>
            Since I came to Stanford, I have kept a list (https://bit.ly/2OP6Sxz)
            of the rituals I observed around me that affected my notion of
            community. Although not recently updated, I am constantly thinking
            about rituals as a way to enact a set of values, to form and unite a
            culture, and to onboard new people to a community. I have found myself
            at the center of many established or new organizations from the
            Stanford Robotics Club to an R&D team at IDEO; these places provide me
            with wonderful blank slates that are just begging someone to introduce
            rituals to. Long story short, I have been working on ritual design in
            an ad-hoc way for many years and am excited to finally meet a group of
            people who share the same passion and bring some formalization and
            practice to this domain.
